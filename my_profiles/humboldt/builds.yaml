## DEFINE BUILDS THAT WE WANT AUGUR TO RUN
## I want a California-focused build that looks at CA dynamics broadly, 
## and also a Humboldt county focused build.

use_nextalign: true
genes: ["ORF1a", "ORF1b", "S", "ORF3a", "M", "N"]

builds:
  # first we'll define a state-level build, focused on California.
  # subsampling schemes that are referenced here are defined after the builds.
  california:
    subsampling_scheme: ca_subsamp #subsampling scheme defined below
    region: North America
    country: USA
    division: California

  humboldt:
    subsampling_scheme: humboldt_subsamp # subsampling scheme defined below
    region: North America
    country: USA
    division: California
    location: Humboldt County


## Now I define the subsampling schemes that will guide how contextual data 
## are pulled in for each of these builds.
subsampling:
  ca_subsamp:
    # Focal samples
    division:
      group_by: "location year month" #subsample from all californian counties (referred to as locations) one monthly cadence
      max_sequences: 1500
      exclude: "--exclude-where 'division!={division}'" #ensure these are calif samples
    # Contextual samples from the rest of the United States
    country:
      group_by: "division year month" #subsample 
      seq_per_group: 4
      exclude: "--exclude-where 'division={division}' 'country!={country}'" # when grabbing samples from other parts of the US, make sure that we're not resampling from CA.
      priorities:
        type: "proximity"
        focus: "division"
    # Contextual samples from the rest of the world,
    global:
      group_by: "region year month"
      seq_per_group: 4
      exclude: "--exclude-where 'country={country}'" #don't resample United States samples
      priorities:
        type: "proximity"
        focus: "division"

  humboldt_subsamp:
    # Focal samples
    location:
      group_by: "year month"
      seq_per_group: 500 #set really high to ensure I get ALL of Humboldt's sequences
      query: --query "(country == '{country}') & (division == '{division}') & (location == '{location}')"
    # Contextual samples from California
    division:
      group_by: "year month"
      seq_per_group: 50
      exclude: "--exclude-where 'location={location}' 'division!={division}'" #make sure we're grabbing Californian samples from counties other than Humboldt.
      priorities:
        type: "proximity"
        focus: "location"
    # Contextual samples from all other states in USA except California
    country:
      group_by: "year month"
      seq_per_group: 50
      exclude: "--exclude-where 'division={division}' 'country!={country}'"
      priorities:
        type: "proximity"

    global:
      group_by: "region year month"
      seq_per_group: 5
      exclude: "--exclude-where 'country={country}'" #do not resample USA

### Specify which discrete traits to reconstruct at ancestors for the two different builds
traits:
    humboldt:
        sampling_bias_correction: 2.5
        columns: ["location", "division"] ### note that these must match column names in metadata.tsv

    california:
        sampling_bias_correction: 2.5
        columns: ["location", "division"]
